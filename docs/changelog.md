# Changelog

## WIP

- Document formatting is now available for `.tra`, `.msg`, and `.2da` files.
- New: 2DA tables have improved highlighting.

## 3.6.0

- Find references from `.tra` and `.msg` files: cursor on any entry finds all usages across consumer files (`.ssl`, `.baf`, `.d`, `.tp2`, `.tssl`, `.tbaf`, `.td`).
- Fallout SSL: go to definition on `#include` path navigates to the included file.
- `weidu.log`: go to definition on `~mod/path.tp2~` navigates to the corresponding `.tp2` file (case-insensitive path resolution).
- Added syntax highlighting for `weidu.log`.
- Binary editor save and JSON export now clamp out-of-range PRO and MAP values to the nearest supported in-format value instead of writing invalid data.
- Binary editor JSON dump now produces strict canonical JSON.

## 3.5.0

- Binary viewer is now an editor, supporting **Dump to JSON** and **Load from JSON** actions, and `autoDumpJson` setting.
- Added best-effort support for Fallout 2 MAP files in the editor and bin cli.
- Added `bit` type support to JSdoc.

## 3.4.0

### Fallout SSL

- Hovering over engine procedure definitions (e.g. `map_enter_p_proc`, `start`) now shows the built-in engine description. If the procedure has user JSDoc, the engine description is appended after a separator.
- Strings with escape sequences (e.g. `\"` and `\\`) now parse correctly.
- `for` loop update expressions now support compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`), e.g. `for (i := 0; i < 10; i += 2)`.
- `##` token-paste operator is now supported in macro bodies — variable declarations, assignments, and expressions — in addition to procedure names. Fixes parse errors in files that use `##` outside of identifiers.
- Fixed hover not working for procedures defined in header files that contain macros using the `##` token-paste operator (e.g. `animate_##type##_to_tile`). The grammar now parses `##` correctly as a context-sensitive operator inside `#define` bodies, preventing a parse error that previously swallowed the rest of the file.
- `##` token-paste operator is now syntax-highlighted as a preprocessor keyword; surrounding identifier segments get function coloring.
- `#include` directives now accept bare identifier paths (without quotes), as used in some real-world scripts.
- `switch` `case` and `default` clauses now accept a `begin ... end` block body (sfall extension), in addition to the standard statement list.
- Macro bodies now allow a top-level assignment without a trailing semicolon.
- Fixed parse errors caused by backslash line-continuation followed by a blank line.
- Fixed parse errors caused by whitespace-only blank lines inside procedure bodies.
- Hover signatures for procedures and macros now show untyped parameters as `var name` and highlight parameter names with `variable.parameter` coloring.
- Fixed rename not working for macro parameters.

### WeiDU

- `ADD_STATE_TRIGGER` now accepts multiple state numbers after the trigger string (e.g. `ADD_STATE_TRIGGER ~file~ N ~trigger~ N1 N2 N3`), matching the WeiDU spec.

### Formatter

- The formatter CLI now exits with a non-zero status when the input file contains syntax errors, instead of silently producing output from a broken AST.

### Transpilers

- Fixed notification popups (success/error messages) appearing on every keystroke or save during automatic validation for TSSL, TBAF, and TD transpilers. Notifications now only appear when compile is triggered manually.

### TSSL

- `map()` with no arguments now transpiles to `{}` (empty map literal).
- Fixed a crash when the source contains empty statements (bare semicolons).

## 3.3.1

Fix standalone LSP package publish after repository rename.

## 3.3.0

- New: semantic highlighting
  - Fallout SSL: function, macro parameters.
  - WeiDU TP2: function parameters, loop vars, JSdoc types.
- WeiDU: translation references (`@NNN`) styling unified across BAF, D, and TP2.
- Textmate highlighting: Fallout SSL, WeiDU TP2, BAF, D are updated to match intellisense data more closely.
- Fallout SSL: header macros definitions are no longer shipped with LSP.
- WeiDU TP2: ielib symbols data is no longer shipped with LSP.
