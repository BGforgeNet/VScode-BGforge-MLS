    - name: combat_p_proc
      doc: |-
        Called in combat (every turn?).
    - name: critter_p_proc
      doc: |-
        This procedure is called every "heartbeat", which means it's run ten times each second, except during combat.
    - name: damage_p_proc
      doc: |-
        Called when the critter takes damage.
    - name: description_p_proc
      doc: |-
        Called when the player inspects the object (binoculars).
    - name: destroy_p_proc
      doc: |-
        Called on death of the critter or destruction of the object (except when using `destroy_object(self_obj)`).
    - name: look_at_p_proc
      doc: |-
        Called when the player passes the cursor over any object.
    - name: map_enter_p_proc
      doc: |-
        Called once by the engine each time the map is entered from another map. It is not run when the elevation is changed.
    - name: map_update_p_proc
      doc: |-
        Called roughly once every 30 seconds. It is also called each time you exit a dialogue, each time you exit the pipboy screen and each time you use an item. In addition to that, it is run once when you enter the map, and, seemingly, twice when you change elevation.
    - name: pickup_p_proc
      doc: |-
        Called when the player is caught stealing from this critter.
    - name: start
      doc: |-
        This procedure is only supposed to be called by the engine when the script is first run, then never again, unless specifically called from somewhere else.
    - name: talk_p_proc
      doc: |-
        Called when the player tries to initiate dialogue with the critter.
    - name: timed_event_p_proc
      doc: |-
        This procedure is called by the function `add_timer_event(ObjPtr obj, int time, int fixed_param)`. ObjPtr points to the object whose script's `timed_event_p_proc` procedure you want to access. Time is the number of game ticks (1 game tick = 1/10 seconds) you want to pass before the `timed_event_p_proc` is called. `fixed_param` is a variable you can set to differentiate between various timed events. In `timed_event_p_proc`, you can check the value of `fixed_param` against whatever number you used when calling `add_timer_event`. This allows for multiple uses of `timed_event_p_proc` in the same script.
    - name: use_obj_on_p_proc
      doc: |

        - A critter uses an object on another critter. (Or themselves).

        - Player or AI uses any drug.
    - name: use_p_proc
      doc: |

        Sets the ambient light level (1-100). The range is Full Darkness to Full Daylight. NOTE: level is NOT percentange, full darkness is not black screen. set_light_level(0) actually corresponds to 25% brightness, and as level increases, brightness makes 2 huge jumps in the middle (49-51). Thus, certain brightness levels simply cannot be set.
