Specify mode as 1 to loop the file continuously, 2 to replace the current background game music with playing the specified file in loop mode, or 0 to play the file once. If you don't wish to loop, `play_sfall_sound` returns 0. If you do loop, it returns an ID which can be passed back to `stop_sfall_sound` when you want to stop the effect. All sounds effects will be stopped on game reload, looping or not. Does not require `AllowDShowSound` to be set to 1 in `ddraw.ini`.

        Starting from sfall 4.2.8/3.8.28, you can pass a value in the `mode` argument for a reduced sound volume. To set the volume, You need to convert the number to hexadecimal and use the argument format `0xZZZZ000Y`, where `ZZZZ` is the volume reduction value in range from 0 to 32767 (the value 32767 is mute), and `Y` is the playback mode.

      detail: void set_attack_is_explosion_fire
      doc: |-
        If you call this right before using a weapon with fire damage type (e.g. in `HOOK_AFTERHITROLL`), it will produce explosion effects (and radius damage) just like "explosion" type, but all targets will still receive fire damage.
    - name: set_dynamite_damage
      detail: void set_dynamite_damage(minDmg, maxDmg)

        Used from a normal global script if you want to run it at the same point a full hook script would normally run. In case of this function, `start` procedure will be executed in current global script. You can use all above functions like normal.
    - name: register_hook_proc
      detail: void register_hook_proc(int hookID, proc procedure)
      doc: |
        The same as `register_hook`, except that you specifically define which procedure in the current script should be called as a hook (instead of "start" by default). Pass procedure the same as how you use dialog option functions. This IS the recommended way to use hook scripts, as it gives both modularity (each mod logic in a separate global script with no conflicts) and flexibility. You can place all related hook scripts for a specific mod in one global script!

        Use zero (0) as second argument to unregister hook script from current global script.

        __NOTE:__ you can hook several scripts to a single hook point, for example if it's different mods from different authors or just some different aspects of one larger mod. When one of the scripts in a chain returns value with `set_sfall_return`, the next script may override this value if calls `set_sfall_return` again.

        __Example:__ Sometimes you need to multiply certain value in a chain of hook scripts. Let's say we have a **Mod A** which reduces all "to hit" chances by 50%. The code might look like this:

        ```js
        original_chance = get_sfall_arg;
        set_sfall_return(original_chance / 2);
        ```

        **Mod B** also want to affect hit chances globally, by increasing them by 50%. Now in order for both mods to work well together, we need to add this line to **Mod A** hook script:
        ```js
        set_sfall_arg(0, (original_chance / 2));
        ```

        This basically changes hook argument for the next script. **Mod B** code:
        ```js
        original_chance = get_sfall_arg;
        set_sfall_return(original_chance * 1.5);
        set_sfall_arg(0, (original_chance * 1.5));
        ```

        So if you combine both mods together, they will run in chain and the end result will be a 75% from original hit chance (hook register order doesn't matter in this case, if you use `set_sfall_arg` in both hooks).

        The defines to use for the `hookID` are in **sfall.h**.

        Works the same as `register_hook_proc`, except that it registers the current script at the end of the hook script execution chain (i.e. the script will be executed after all previously registered scripts for the same hook, including the `hs_<name>.int` script). In addition, all scripts hooked to a single hook point with this function are executed in the exact order of how they were registered. In the case of using `register_hook` and `register_hook_proc` functions, scripts are executed in reverse order of how they were registered.
        **The execution chain of script procedures for a hook is as follows:** 1. Procedures registered with `register_hook` and `register_hook_proc` functions (executed in reverse order of registration). 2. The `hs_<name>.int` script. 3. Procedures registered with the `register_hook_proc_spec` function (executed in the exact order of registration).

    - name: force_encounter
      detail: void force_encounter(int map)
      doc: |-
        Can be called either from a global script while traveling on the world map, or from a normal script while on a local map. In either case the encounter occurs shortly after the next time the player moves on the world map. The player will not get an outdoorsman skill check.
    - name: force_encounter_with_flags
      detail: void force_encounter_with_flags(int map, int flags)
      doc: |
        Does the same thing as force_encounter, but allows the specification of some extra options (see **sfall.h** for available flags).
        Forcing a random encounter on a map that is not normally used for random encounters may cause the player to lose the car, if they have it. In this case use `force_encounter_with_flags` with the `ENCOUNTER_FLAG_NO_CAR` flag set.
    - name: get_map_enter_position
      detail: array get_map_enter_position()
      doc: |-
        Returns an array of the player's position data (index: 0 - tile, 1 - elevation, 2 - rotation) when entering the map through exit grids. If entering from the world map, the tile value will be -1. Should be called in `map_enter_p_proc` procedure to get the correct position data.

      detail: bool in_world_map
      doc: |-
        Returns 1 if the player is looking at the world map, or 0 at any other time. Obviously this is only useful in global scripts, since normal scripts will never get the chance to run on the world map.
    - name: set_map_enter_position
      detail: void set_map_enter_position(int tile, int elevation, int rotation)
      doc: |-
        Overrides the players entry position when entering the map through exit grids. Setting the tile to 0 will put the player on the start hex (default tile and elevation) of the map. Works only in `map_enter_p_proc` procedure.
    - name: set_map_time_multi
      detail: void set_map_time_multi(float multi)
      doc: |-
        Adjusts how fast time passes while you're on the world map. It takes a single float as an argument, where 1 is the normal speed. This function works in addition to the `WorldMapTimeMod` setting in `ddraw.ini` and the Pathfinder perk, rather than overriding it, so calling `set_map_time_multi(0.5)` when the player has 2 levels of Pathfinder would result in time passing at 25% the normal speed on the world map.

      detail: int (ObjectPtr invenObj, ObjectPtr itemObj)
      doc: |-
        Returns number of `itemObj` inside invenObj's inventory, note that both arguments are object pointers. useful when dealing with different stacks of same item (`obj_is_carrying_obj_pid` just returns total for all stacks of the same PID.)
    - name: obj_is_openable

      doc: |
        Returns the object under the cursor on the main game screen.
        - onlyCritter:
          - True - only checks critters and ignores their cover (roof tiles, walls, scenery, etc.)
          - False - checks all objects (can't check critters under objects)
        - passing False to the includeDude argument will ignore dude_obj
          - **NOTE:** to get an object located on a tile when the cursor is in movement mode (hexagon cursor), use the `tile_under_cursor` function
    - name: real_dude_obj

      detail: void set_flags(ObjectPtr obj, int flags)
      doc: |-
        Sets the current flags of an object. All flags are rewritten with given integer, so first get current flags with `get_flags` and use `bwor/bwand` to set/remove specific flag.
    - name: set_object_data

        Sets the data at the specified offset of an object.
    - name: set_scr_name
      detail: void set_scr_name(string name)
      doc: |
        Overrides the name of the script object that was set from `scrname.msg`.
        - The changed name will be reset each time the player leaves the map or reloads the game
        - Passing an empty string ("") to the `name` argument or omitting it will allow the game to get the name for the object from pro_*.msg files
        - __NOTE:__ this function is intended for use in normal game scripts and overrides the name only once for the same object until reset
    - name: set_script
      detail: void set_script(ObjectPtr obj, int scriptID)
      doc: |-
        Accepts a pointer to an object and scriptID, and applies the given script to an object (scriptID accept the same values as `create_object_sid `from sfall 3.6). If used on an object that is already scripted, it will remove the existing script first; you cannot have multiple scripts attached to a single object. Calling `set_script` on `self_obj` will have all sorts of wacky side effects, and should be avoided. If you add 0x80000000 to the sid when calling `set_script`, `map_enter_p_proc` will be SKIPPED. The `start` proc will always be run.
    - name: set_self
      detail: void set_self(ObjectPtr setObj)
      doc: |
        Overrides the script's `self_obj` for the next function call.
        - It is primarily used to allow the calling of functions which take an implicit `self_obj` parameter (e.g. `drop_obj`) from global scripts, but it can also be used from normal scripts.
        - `self_obj` will be reverted to its original value after the next function call.
        - Calling `set_self(0)` will also revert `self_obj` to its original value. It is recommended to call this after each use of `set_self` in normal scripts in order to avoid unforeseen side effects.
        - `source_obj`, `target_obj`, and similar functions will not work if preceded by `set_self`.
        - __NOTE:__ for `use_obj`, `use_obj_on_obj` vanilla functions to work correctly, it is required to call `set_self` twice. You can also access the local variables in the script of an object after calling `set_self` twice.
    - name: set_unique_id
      detail: int set_unique_id(ObjectPtr object, int flag)
      doc: |
        Assigns a unique ID number to the object and returns it. If a unique ID number has already been assigned to an object, then ID number is returned without reassignment. `flag` is optional.
        - items with unique IDs will not stack with other items of the same type in the inventory
        - to just get the current ID number of an object, use `get_object_data(object, OBJ_DATA_ID)`
        - unique ID numbers are saved in your savegame, and have a range from 0x10000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF
        - there is also a unique ID number range for the player and party members from 18000 to 83535
        - to assign a new ID number generated by the engine to the object (i.e. unassign a unique ID), call the function with two arguments and pass -1 for the flag argument

    - name: game_loaded
      detail: int game_loaded()
      doc: |-
        Returns 1 the first time it is called after a new game or game load, and 0 any time after. It works on an individual basis for each script, so one script wont interfere with others. Its primary use is for global scripts, so that they know when to call `set_global_script_repeat`, but it can be called from normal scripts too.

        Takes a party member PID or an NPC name (deprecated, for compatibility with sfall 4.1.5/3.8.15 or earlier) as an argument. The NPC must be in your party. This function ignores player level requirements and the minimum 3 player level delay between NPC level gains. It also ignores the random element, regardless of sfall's `NPCAutoLevel` setting.

      doc: |
        Cuts a substring from a string starting at "start" up to "length" characters. The first character position is 0 (zero).
        - If start is negative - it indicates a position starting from the end of the string (for example `substr("test", -2, 2)` will return last 2 charactes: "st").
        - If length is negative - it means so many characters will be omitted from the end of string (example: `substr("test", 0, -2)` will return string without last 2 characters: "te").
        - If length is zero - it will return a string from the starting position to the end of the string. **New behavior** for sfall 4.2.2/3.8.22

        __NOTE:__ These hook scripts can become very CPU-intensive and you should avoid using them.
        For this reason, these hooks are not thoroughly supported in sfall, and may be removed in future versions.<br>
        If you want to check if some tile or path is blocked, use functions: `obj_blocking_tile`, `obj_blocking_line`, `path_find_to`.<br>

        ```
    - name: HOOK_FINDTARGET
      doc: |
        Runs when the AI is trying to pick a target in combat. Fallout first chooses a list of 4 likely suspects, then normally sorts them in order of weakness/distance/etc depending on the AI caps of the attacker.<br>
        This hook replaces that sorting function, allowing you to sort the targets in some arbitrary way.

        The return values can include critters that weren't in the list of possible targets, but the additional targets may still be discarded later on in the combat turn if they are out of the attackers perception or the chance of a successful hit is too low. The list of possible targets often includes duplicated entries, but this is fixed in sfall 4.2.3/3.8.23.
        Use `set_sfall_return` to give the 4 targets, in order of preference. If you want to specify less than 4 targets, fill in the extra spaces with 0's or pass -1 to skip the return value.

        __NOTE:__ The engine can choose targets by the following criteria:
        1) The nearest enemy to the attacker.
        2) The enemy that attacked the attacker.
        3) The enemy that attacked an NPC from the same team as the attacker.
        4) The enemy that is attacked by an NPC from the same team as the attacker.

        ```
        Critter arg0 - The attacker
        Critter arg1 - A possible target
        Critter arg2 - A possible target
        Critter arg3 - A possible target
        Critter arg4 - A possible target

        Critter ret0 - The first choice of target
        Critter ret1 - The second choice of target

    - name: HOOK_INVENWIELD
      doc: |
        Runs before causing a critter or the player to wield/unwield an armor or a weapon (except when using the inventory by PC).
        An example usage would be to change critter art depending on armor being used or to dynamically customize weapon animations.

        __NOTE:__ When replacing a previously wielded armor or weapon, the unwielding hook will not be executed.
        If you need to rely on this, try checking if armor/weapon is already equipped when wielding hook is executed.

        ```
        Critter arg0 - critter
        Item    arg1 - item being wielded or unwielded (weapon/armor)
        int     arg2 - slot (INVEN_TYPE_*)
        int     arg3 - 1 when wielding, 0 when unwielding
        int     arg4 - 1 when removing an equipped item from inventory, 0 otherwise

    - name: HOOK_INVENTORYMOVE
      doc: |
        Runs before moving items between inventory slots in dude interface. You can override the action.

        What you can NOT do with this hook:
        - force moving items to inappropriate slots (like gun in armor slot)
        What you can do:
        - restrict player from using specific weapons or armors
        - add AP costs for all inventory movement including reloading
        - apply or remove some special scripted effects depending on PC's armor

        ```
        int     arg0 - Target slot:

                       7 - picking up item
                       8 - dropping item on the character portrait
        Item    arg1 - Item being moved
        Item    arg2 - Item being replaced, weapon being reloaded, or container being filled (can be 0)

        int     ret0 - Override setting (-1 - use engine handler, any other value - prevent relocation of item/reloading weapon/picking up item)
        ```

        Notes for the event of dropping items on the ground:
        - the event is called for each item when dropping multiple items from the stack
        - for ammo type items, the number of dropped ammo in a pack can be found by using the `get_weapon_ammo_count` function
        - for the `PID_BOTTLE_CAPS` item, the event is called only once, and the number of dropped units can be found from the value of the `OBJ_DATA_CUR_CHARGES` object field (or with the `get_weapon_ammo_count` function)

      doc: |
        Runs after Fallout executes a standard procedure (handler) in any script of any object.
        NOTE: this hook will not be executed for `start`, `critter_p_proc`, `timed_event_p_proc`, and `map_update_p_proc` procedures.

        ```
        int     arg0 - the number of the standard script handler (see *_proc in define.h)
        Obj     arg1 - the object that owns this handler (self_obj)
        Obj     arg2 - the object that called this handler (source_obj, can be 0)
        int     arg3 - always 1 (procedure end)
        Obj     arg4 - the object that is acted upon by this handler (target_obj, can be 0)
        int     arg5 - the parameter of this call (fixed_param), useful for combat_proc
        ```
    - name: HOOK_STEAL
      doc: |
        Runs when checking an attempt to steal or plant an item in other inventory using Steal skill.

        This is fired before the default handlers are called, which you can override. In this case you MUST provide message of the result to player ("You steal the %s", "You are caught planting the %s", etc.).
        Example message (vanilla behavior):<br>
        `display_msg(sprintf(mstr_skill(570 + (isSuccess != false) + arg3 * 2), obj_name(arg2)));`

        ```
        Critter arg0 - Thief
        Obj     arg1 - The target
        Item    arg2 - The item being stolen/planted
        int     arg3 - 0 when stealing, 1 when planting
        int     arg4 - quantity of the item being stolen/planted

        int     ret0 - overrides hard-coded handler (2 - force fail without closing window, 1 - force success, 0 - force fail, -1 - use engine handler)
        int     ret1 - overrides experience points gained for stealing this item (must be greater than or equal to 0)
        ```
    - name: HOOK_SUBCOMBATDAMAGE
      doc: |
        This hook overrides the vanilla damage calculation formula.
        Runs when:
        1. Before the game calculates how much damage each target will get. This includes primary target as well as all extras (explosions and bursts).
        2. AI decides whether it is safe to use area attack (burst, grenades), if he might hit friendlies.

        Does not run for misses, non-combat damage like dynamite explosions, or if one of the damage formulas is selected in ddraw.ini.

        ```
        Critter arg0 - the attacker
        Critter arg1 - the target
        Item    arg2 - the weapon used in the attack
        int     arg3 - attack type (see ATKTYPE_* constants)
        int     arg4 - number of bullets actually hit the target (1 for melee attacks)
        int     arg5 - target's Damage Resistance (DR) value (affected by critical hit effects, perks, traits, and special unarmed attacks)
        int     arg6 - target's Damage Threshold (DT) value (affected by critical hit effects, perks, traits, and special unarmed attacks)
        int     arg7 - bonus ranged damage from the perk
        int     arg8 - damage multiplier (this is divided by 2, so a value of 3 does 1.5x damage, and 8 does 4x damage. Usually it's 2; for critical hits, the value is taken from the critical table; with Silent Death perk and the corresponding attack conditions, the value will be doubled)
        int     arg9 - combat difficulty multiplier (125 - rough, 100 - normal, 75 - wimpy; for player or party members it's always 100)
        int     arg10 - the calculated amount of damage (usually 0, required when using multiple hook scripts to calculate damage and using the set_sfall_arg function)
        mixed   arg11 - computed attack data (see C_ATTACK_* for offsets and use get/set_object_data functions to get/set the data)

        int     ret0 - the returned amount of damage
        ```
    - name: HOOK_TARGETOBJECT
      doc: |
        Runs when the targeting cursor hovers over an object, or when the player tries to attack the target object.
        You can override the target object or prevent the player from attacking the chosen target.

        ```
        int     arg0 - event type: 0 - when the targeting cursor hovers over the object, 1 - when trying to attack the target object
        int     arg1 - 1 when the target object is valid to attack, 0 otherwise
        Obj     arg2 - the target object

        mixed   ret0 - overrides the target object, or pass -1 to prevent the player from attacking the object
        ```
    - name: HOOK_TOHIT
      doc: |
        Runs when Fallout is calculating the chances of an attack striking a target.<br>
        Runs after the hit chance is fully calculated normally, including applying the 95% cap.

        ```
        int     arg0 - The hit chance (capped)
        Critter arg1 - The attacker
        Critter arg2 - The target of the attack
        int     arg3 - The targeted bodypart
        int     arg4 - Source tile (may differ from attacker's tile, when AI is considering potential fire position)
        int     arg5 - Attack Type (see ATKTYPE_* constants)
        int     arg6 - Ranged flag. 1 if the hit chance calculation takes into account the distance to the target. This does not mean the attack is a ranged attack
        int     arg7 - The raw hit chance before applying the cap

        int     ret0 - The new hit chance. The value is limited to the range of -99 to 999
        ```
    - name: HOOK_USEANIMOBJ
      doc: |
        Runs before playing the "use" (usually "magic hands") animation when a critter uses a scenery/container object on the map, or before walking/running animation if the player is at a distance from the object.

        ```
        Critter arg0 - the critter that uses an object (usually dude_obj)
        Obj     arg1 - the object being used
        int     arg2 - the animation code being used (see ANIM_* in Animcomd.h)

        int     ret0 - overrides the animation code (pass -1 if you want to skip the animation)
        ```
    - name: HOOK_USEOBJ
      doc: |
        Runs when:
        1. a critter uses an object from inventory which have "Use" action flag set or it's an active flare or dynamite.
        2. player uses an object from main interface

        This is fired before the object is used, and the relevant `use_obj` script procedures are run. You can disable default item behavior.

        __NOTE:__ You can't remove and/or destroy this object during the hookscript (game will crash otherwise). To remove it, return 1.

        ```
        Critter arg0 - The user
        Obj     arg1 - The object used

        int     ret0 - overrides hard-coded handler and selects what should happen with the item (0 - place it back, 1 - remove it, -1 - use engine handler)
        ```
    - name: HOOK_USEOBJON
      doc: |
        Runs when:
        1. a critter uses an object on another critter. (Or themselves)
        1. a critter uses an object from inventory screen AND this object does not have "Use" action flag set and it's not active flare or explosive.
        1. player or AI uses any drug

        This is fired before the object is used, and the relevant `use_obj_on` script procedures are run. You can disable default item behavior.

        __NOTE:__ You can't remove and/or destroy this object during the hookscript (game will crash otherwise). To remove it, return 1.

        ```
        Critter arg0 - The target
        Critter arg1 - The user
        int     arg2 - The object used

        int     ret0 - overrides hard-coded handler and selects what should happen with the item (0 - place it back, 1 - remove it, -1 - use engine handler)
        ```
    - name: HOOK_USESKILL
      doc: |
        Runs when using any skill on any object.

        This is fired before the default handlers are called, which you can override. In this case you should write your own skill use handler entirely, or otherwise nothing will happen (this includes fade in/fade out, time lapsing and messages - all of this can be scripted; to get vanilla text messages - use `message_str_game` along with `sprintf`).
        Suggested use - override First Aid/Doctor skills to buff/nerf them, override Steal skill to disallow observing NPCs inventories in some cases.

        Does not run if the script of the object calls `script_overrides` for using the skill.

        ```
        Critter arg0 - The user critter
        Obj     arg1 - The target object
        int     arg2 - skill being used
        int     arg3 - skill bonus from items such as first aid kits

        int     ret0 - overrides hard-coded handler (-1 - use engine handler, any other value - override; if it is 0, there will be a 10% chance of removing the used medical item)
        ```
    - name: HOOK_USESKILLON
      doc: |
        Runs before using any skill on any object. Lets you override the critter that uses the skill.

        __NOTE:__ The user critter can't be overridden when using Steal skill.

        ```
        Critter arg0 - the user critter (usually dude_obj)
        Obj     arg1 - the target object/critter
        int     arg2 - skill being used

        int     ret0 - a new critter to override the user critter. Pass -1 to cancel the skill use, pass 0 to skip this return value
        int     ret1 - pass 1 to allow the skill to be used in combat (only for dude_obj or critter being controlled by the player)
        ```
    - name: HOOK_WITHINPERCEPTION
      doc: |
        Runs when checking if one critter sees another critter. This is used in different situations like combat AI. You can override the result.

        __NOTE:__ `obj_can_see_obj` calls this first when deciding if critter can possibly see another critter with regard to perception, lighting, sneak factors.<br>
        If check fails, the end result is false. If check succeeds (e.g. critter is within perception range), another check is made if there is any blocking tile between two critters (which includes stuff like windows, large bushes, barrels, etc.) and if there is - check still fails.<br>
        You can override "within perception" check by returning 0 or 1, OR, as a convenience, you can also override blocking check after the perception check by returning 2 instead. In this case you should add "line of sight" check inside your hook script, otherwise critters will detect you through walls.

        This is fired after the default calculation is made.

        ```
        Critter arg0 - Watcher object
        Obj     arg1 - Target object
        int     arg2 - Result of vanilla function: 1 - within perception range, 0 - otherwise
        int     arg3 - Type of hook:
            1 - when being called from obj_can_see_obj script function
            2 - when being called from obj_can_hear_obj script function (need to set ObjCanHearObjFix=1 in ddraw.ini)
            3 - when AI determines whether it sees a potential target when selecting attack targets
            0 - all other cases

        int     ret0 - overrides the returned result of the function:
                       0 - not in range (can't see)
                       1 - in range (will see if not blocked)
                       2 - forced detection (will see regardless, only used in obj_can_see_obj script function which is called by every critter in the game)
        ```
