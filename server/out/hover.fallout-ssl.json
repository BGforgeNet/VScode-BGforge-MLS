Pass procedure the same as how you use dialog option functions. This IS the recommended way to use hook scripts, as it gives both modularity (each mod logic in a separate global script, no conflicts if you don't use \"hs_*.int\" scripts) and flexibility (you can place all related hook scripts for specific mod in a single script!).\n\nUse zero (0) as second argument to unregister hook script from current global script.\n\n__NOTE:__ you can hook several scripts to a single hook point, for example if it's different mods from different authors or just some different aspects of one larger mod. In this case scripts are executed in reverse order of how they were registered. When one of the scripts in a chain returns value with `set_sfall_return`, the next script may override this value if calls `set_sfall_return` again. Sometimes you need to multiply certain value in a chain of hook scripts.\n\nExample: let's say we have a Mod A which reduces all \"to hit\" chances by 50%. The code might look like this:\n\n```js\noriginal_chance = get_sfall_arg;\nset_sfall_return(original_chance / 2);\n```\n\nMod B also want to affect hit chances globally, by increasing them by 50%. Now in order for both mods to work well together, we need to add this line to Mod A hook script:\n```js\nset_sfall_arg(0, (original_chance / 2));\n```\n\nThis basically changes hook argument for the next script. Mod B code:\n```js\noriginal_chance = get_sfall_arg;\nset_sfall_return(original_chance * 1.5);\nset_sfall_arg(0, (original_chance * 1.5));\n```\n\nSo if you combine both mods together, they will run in chain and the end result will be a 75% from original hit chance (hook register order doesn't matter in this case, if you use `set_sfall_arg` in both hooks).\n\nThe defines to use for the `hookID` are in `sfall.h`.\n"
