        This action instructs the script parser to continue looking for actions in the active creatures action list. This is mainly included in scripts for efficiency. Continue should also be appended to any script blocks added to the top of existing scripts, to ensure correct functioning of any blocks which include the OnCreation trigger. Continue may prevent actions being completed until the script parser has finished its execution cycle. Continue() must be the last command in an action list to function correctly. Use of continue in a script block will cause the parser to treater subsequent empty response blocks as though they contained a Continue() command - this parsing can be stopped by including a NoAction() in the empty response block.

        This action removes all instances of the specified item from the party. The items are placed in the inventory of the active creature. Items contained in containers (e.g. Bag of Holding) are not taken.
    - name: TakePartyItemNum
      detail: TakePartyItemNum(S:ResRef, I:Num)
      doc: |-
        This action will remove a number of instances (specified by the Num parameter) of the specified item from the party. The items will be removed from players in order, for example; Player1 has 3 instances of "MYITEM" in their inventory, Player2 has 2 instance of "MYITEM," and Player3 has 1 instance. If the action TakePartyItemNum("MYITEM", 4) is run, all 3 instances of "MYITEM" will be taken from Player1, and 1 instance will be taken from Player2. This leaves Player2 and Player3 each with one instance of "MYITEM." If the last item of an item type stored in a container STO file is removed by this action, the amount becomes zero. Items with zero quantities cannot be seen in-game, cannot be removed by TakePartyItem, and will not count toward a container's current item load. If the item to be taken is in a stack, and the stack is in a quickslot, the item will be removed, and the remaining stack will be placed in the inventory. If the inventory is full, the stack item will be dropped on the ground.

      doc: |-
        This action turns any undead creatures within range of the active creature. This action can be used for any creature (not just paladins/clerics) though success in turning is dependent on the Turn Undead level of the creature, which is only calculated for paladins and clerics. The chance to successfully turn undead is based on creatures level and class. Paladins turn at 2 levels less than clerics of the same level. An undead creature will be destroyed/controlled if its level is more than 7 levels below the active creatures turn undead level. An undead creature may be turned (i.e. forced to flee) is its level is equal to, or up to 4 levels below, the active creatures turn undead level.
