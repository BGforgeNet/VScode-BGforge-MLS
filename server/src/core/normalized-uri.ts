 * Branded URI type that guarantees consistent percent-encoding.

 * as Map keys or in Set lookups causes silent mismatches.
 *
 * NormalizedUri solves this by canonicalizing file:// URIs through a
 * fileURLToPath -> pathToFileURL round-trip, which produces consistent encoding.
 * The branded type makes it a compile-time error to use raw strings where
