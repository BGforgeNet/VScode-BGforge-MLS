/**
 * LanguageProvider type and supporting definitions.
 *
 * LanguageProvider is composed from capability interfaces defined in
 * core/capabilities.ts. Each capability represents a cohesive feature set.
 * All capabilities are optional (Partial) — providers implement only what
 * their language supports.
 *
 * Concrete providers can declare explicit `implements` clauses for type safety:
 *   class MyProvider implements ProviderBase, FormattingCapability, CompletionCapability { ... }
 *
 * This file re-exports all types from capabilities.ts so existing import
 * sites (`from "./language-provider"`) continue to work unchanged.
