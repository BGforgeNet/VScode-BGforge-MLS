/**
 * Declaration site patterns: detect when the cursor is on a new symbol name being declared.
 * Split into two categories to enable different completion behavior:
 * - "assignment": variable SET/SPRINT - show local variable completions (for reassignment)
 * - "definition": function/macro/array/loop - suppress all completions (new unique name)
 *
 * Why regex instead of tree-sitter AST:
 * At declaration sites the user is mid-typing a new identifier (e.g. `OUTER_SET fo|`).
 * Tree-sitter cannot produce a valid declaration node for incomplete input — the grammar
 * requires both a name and a value (`OUTER_SET name = expr`), so partial input lands in
 * an ERROR node. An earlier attempt modified the grammar to make parts optional, but this
 * introduced unresolvable ambiguities (e.g. optional `BEGIN...END` on function definitions
 * conflicted with the `component` rule). This is a known tree-sitter limitation —
 * error recovery does not produce typed incomplete nodes, only ERROR nodes with no
 * reliable structure to match against (see https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/923).
 * Line-text regex is the fallback convention used throughout this codebase for similar
 * incomplete-input scenarios (see FUNC_CALL_KEYWORDS above).
