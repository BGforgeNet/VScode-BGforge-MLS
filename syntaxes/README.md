Do not edit JSON files.

All syntaxes here are written in `yml` and converted to `json` with `scripts/syntaxes-to-json.sh`. That script is launched manually on demand.

YAML is easier to maintain, because it's less verbose and allows comments.

## Contents

Three categories of grammars:

- **11 primary language grammars** — syntax highlighting for each supported language
- **4 tooltip grammars** — hover rendering (used by VSCode tooltip panels)
- **3 injection grammars** — comments, strings, docstrings (injected into primary grammars)

See [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md#textmate-grammars) for architecture details.
